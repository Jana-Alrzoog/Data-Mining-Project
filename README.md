# IBM HR Analytics Attrition Project

## Project Information

This project is part of a data mining course where we aim to analyze and predict employee attrition (whether employees leave the company or stay) using real-world data. The dataset we selected for this project is the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset**, which contains various attributes related to employees such as age, job role, monthly income, and work-life balance.


## Project Motivation

We decided to work on this dataset because employee attrition is a critical problem for many organizations. High attrition rates can lead to increased costs, decreased productivity, and lower employee morale. By analyzing factors that contribute to attrition, we can help companies take proactive steps to retain valuable employees, improve work-life balance, and reduce turnover costs.

This dataset provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing employee decisions to stay or leave, making it a perfect opportunity for us to apply data mining techniques and machine learning models to a real-world HR problem.
