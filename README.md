## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a university course in **Data Mining**. Our goal was to analyze and predict employee attrition (whether employees leave the company or stay) using the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset**.

The dataset includes features such as:
- Age, gender, and marital status
- Job role and department
- Monthly income and overtime
- Satisfaction levels and work-life balance

Our objective: **identify patterns and build predictive models** to determine which employees are at risk of leaving.

Employee attrition is a major issue for companies worldwide. High turnover:
- Increases training and recruitment costs
- Reduces productivity and morale
- Disrupts team stability

By applying machine learning and data mining techniques, businesses can:
- Proactively identify at-risk employees
- Optimize workplace policies
- Improve employee satisfaction and engagement
